# Manufacturing Line Productivity Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This Power BI project analyzes the production efficiency of a beverage company’s manufacturing line. The aim is to uncover causes of downtime and suggest actionable improvements to enhance operator efficiency and reduce production delays.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Calculate total production time for each batch.
- Identify average downtime by factor across batches.
- Measure downtime percentage per batch.
- Compute operator efficiency by comparing actual vs. minimum batch time.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Current production efficiency: **64%**
- Potential efficiency if **Non-Operator Errors** are reduced: **76%**
- Operator efficiencies range from **73% to 77%** (excluding non-operator errors)
- Major issues:
  - **Machine Adjustment Errors** (suggest training with supervisor oversight)
  - **Batch Coding & Calibration Errors** (suggest manual guide creation)

## 📁 Dataset Description

The analysis used private production data with the following structure:

- **Line productivity**: Batch-level production details
- **Products**: Product info such as flavor, size, and minimum batch time
- **Line downtime**: Downtime by factor per batch
- **Downtime factors**: Description of factors and operator error flags
